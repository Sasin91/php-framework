        <h1>THE UPCYCLE</h1>
        The Upcycle transforms bicycle waste in to beautifully designed Upcycles. Everyday use Upcycle family products, such as chairs, lamps, and belts.
        The Upcycle is born out of necessity. The necessity to look further and differently at what is already around us. Out of the box, innovative, inspirational, socially driven, creative, technical and design, are all terms that represent our essence.
        What drives us? The simple fact that so much garbage is left to be destroyed or left to be forgotten, to search for further solutions/possibilities in transforming this waste into useful, efficient and gorgeous products.
